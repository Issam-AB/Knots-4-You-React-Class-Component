## The frontend

The frontend was developed with [**_ReactJS_**](https://reactjs.org/) with [**_Redux-Saga_**](https://redux-saga.js.org/) using [**_axios_**](https://www.npmjs.com/package/axios) to request the [**_json-server_**](https://www.npmjs.com/package/json-server) API.
[**_react-router-dom_**](https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-router-dom) was used to handle the routes in this application.
